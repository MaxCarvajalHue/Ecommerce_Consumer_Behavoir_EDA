## Briefing

![](https://www.sappiencia.com/images/ecommerce-management-sappiencia.gif)

The CEO of our new eCommerce company hired us to design a new **ad** **strategy** that would generate the maximum income for the company. Hence, our goal is to identify the most profitable customer targets and determine which products we should show them in order to achieve the highest possible conversion rate. They provided us with this dataset containing information about customer demographics and their purchase behavior. This is a wealth of valuable data available in most eCommerce platforms thanks to account registrations. Let's see how we can design a great **ad campaign using data analysis and business intelligence!**

## Set Up

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

Data <- read_csv("Data.csv")

#You can download dataset from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salahuddinahmedshuvo/ecommerce-consumer-behavior-analysis-data

#Credits to: Salahuddin Ahmed : https://www.kaggle.com/salahuddinahmedshuvo Thank You for this great Dataset!
```

### Check The Database Upload

```{r}
#Let's see how the dataset looks!
head(Data)
```

## Data cleaning & preparation

The dataset has loaded correctly. We can see that it contains 28 columns, many of which have different data types. However, they are not correctly identified by R, which may make it difficult for us to obtain statistics and other insights from the data. Therefore, we will fix this.

```{r fixing data types, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#We might use Customer_ID for grouping later, therefore, we have to make it a factor variable, the other variables are logic to convert to their corresponding Data Type

Data2 <- Data %>%
  mutate(
    Customer_ID = as.character(Customer_ID),  # ID is usually a character to preserve leading zeros
    Age = as.integer(Age),  # Age is a whole number
    Gender = as.factor(Gender),  # Gender is categorical
    Income_Level = as.factor(Income_Level),  # Income categories (e.g., Low, Medium, High)
    Marital_Status = as.factor(Marital_Status),  # Categorical (Single, Married, etc.)
    Education_Level = as.factor(Education_Level),  # Categorical
    Occupation = as.factor(Occupation),  # Categorical
    Location = as.factor(Location),  # Categorical (City/Region)
    Purchase_Category = as.factor(Purchase_Category),  # Categorical
    Purchase_Amount = as.numeric(Purchase_Amount),  # Numeric (money amount)
    Frequency_of_Purchase = as.integer(Frequency_of_Purchase),  # Whole number (e.g., times per month)
    Purchase_Channel = as.factor(Purchase_Channel),  # Categorical (Online, In-Store, etc.)
    Brand_Loyalty = as.numeric(Brand_Loyalty),  # likert scale 1-5
    Product_Rating = as.numeric(Product_Rating),  # Numeric (1-5 stars)
    `Time_Spent_on_Product_Research(hours)` = as.numeric(`Time_Spent_on_Product_Research(hours)`),  # Numeric
    Social_Media_Influence = as.factor(Social_Media_Influence),  # Categorical (e.g., High, Medium, Low)
    Discount_Sensitivity = as.factor(Discount_Sensitivity),  # Categorical
    Return_Rate = as.numeric(Return_Rate),  # Numeric (percentage or count)
    Customer_Satisfaction = as.numeric(Customer_Satisfaction),  # Numeric (1-10 scale)
    Engagement_with_Ads = as.factor(Engagement_with_Ads),  # Categorical
    Device_Used_for_Shopping = as.factor(Device_Used_for_Shopping),  # Categorical
    Payment_Method = as.factor(Payment_Method),  # Categorical (e.g., Credit Card, PayPal)
    Time_of_Purchase = as.POSIXct(Time_of_Purchase, format="%m/%d/%Y"),  # Date-Time format
    Discount_Used = as.logical(Discount_Used),  # Boolean (TRUE/FALSE)
    Customer_Loyalty_Program_Member = as.logical(Customer_Loyalty_Program_Member),  # Boolean (TRUE/FALSE)
    Purchase_Intent = as.factor(Purchase_Intent),  # Categorical (e.g., High, Medium, Low)
    Shipping_Preference = as.factor(Shipping_Preference),  # Categorical
    Time_to_Decision = as.numeric(Time_to_Decision)  # Numeric (e.g., minutes/hours)
  )
```

Now, lets evaluate how the data set looks like!

```{r}
str(Data2)
```

Great! We now have the correct data types for our variables. However, there is something that might seem like a problem—the variable **"Purchase Amount"** is full of **NA** values. These are null values, and it would be a significant issue if this variable contained only **NA** values, as it is crucial for generating impactful insights. Let's check if that is the case.

```{r}
sum(is.na(Data2$Purchase_Amount))
```

As you can see, the entire column is filled with **NA** values. This is because the column is written as **"\$."**—the currency symbol causes the conversion to produce **NA** values since it is not a numeric character. Let's remove the symbol and process the column again.

```{r}
Data2$Purchase_Amount <- gsub("\\$", "", Data$Purchase_Amount)
Data2$Purchase_Amount <- as.numeric(Data2$Purchase_Amount)
str(Data2$Purchase_Amount)
```

Awesome! Now that our variables have the correct data type let's take a look to the statistics of this data frame.

```{r}
summary(Data2)
```

Wow! This is great. From the summary of the dataset, we can start uncovering meaningful insights about the business we are working with. For example:

-   First, the database appears to be well-balanced in terms of income levels, marital status, and purchase categories.

-   We also notice that the company seems to be focusing more on one gender, possibly due to a gender inclusion update in their values.

-   Additionally, most customers purchase through mixed channels, meaning the majority shop both online and in-store.

-   The majority of payments are made using PayPal.

-   Most clients are highly sensitive to discounts; however, at the same time, they do not belong to the customer loyalty program.

## Data Visualization

We've already discovered some insights about the company's clients and their behavior. However, we need more information to propose an ad strategy that will be worth the investment. Let's create some cross-visualizations to uncover deeper insights from our data.

First, I would really like to determine which channel generates more revenue. Since running a physical store is more expensive than maintaining a website, the expectation would be that the store generates more income.

```{r}
# Let's take advantage of sqldf function and create a dataset for this plot using SQL
sales_per_channel <- sqldf(
"SELECT `Purchase_Channel`, SUM(`Purchase_Amount`) AS sales_tot
 FROM Data2
  GROUP BY `Purchase_Channel`
  ORDER BY sales_tot DESC")

# Bar Plot
plot_channel_sales <- ggplot(sales_per_channel, aes(x = reorder(`Purchase_Channel`, sales_tot), y = sales_tot, fill = `Purchase_Channel`)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip() +  
  labs(title = "Total sales by Purchase Channel",
       x = "Purchase Channel",
       y = "Purchase Volume") +
  theme(
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "gray20", color = "black"), 
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "gray20"), 
    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "white", linetype = "dashed"),  
    panel.grid.minor = element_line(color = "white", linetype = "dashed"),  
    axis.text = element_text(color = "white"),  
    axis.title = element_text(color = "white"), 
    plot.title = element_text(color = "white", hjust = 0.5, face = "bold"),  
    legend.background = element_rect(fill = "gray20", color = "black"), 
    legend.text = element_text(color = "white"), 
    legend.title = element_text(color = "white")) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = dollar_format(prefix = "$"))

plot_channel_sales
```

We can clearly see that the channel with the highest traffic is the online channel. Given that it is the most popular, with lower costs for maintaining a website, and considering the need to create an ad campaign to boost sales, we will focus solely on analyzing online sales and develop a proposal based on the insights we gather.

Before moving forward, we need to ensure that this sales volume isn't simply due to a higher number of purchases. Therefore, we will plot the number of purchases by channel.

```{r}
ggplot(Data2, aes(x = Purchase_Channel, fill = Purchase_Channel)) +
  geom_bar() + 
  labs(title = "Number of Purchases per Channel",
       x = "Purchase Channel",
       y = "Number of Purchases") +
  theme(
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "gray20", color = "black"), 
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "gray20"), 
    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "white", linetype = "dashed"),  
    panel.grid.minor = element_line(color = "white", linetype = "dashed"),  
    axis.text = element_text(color = "white"),  
    axis.title = element_text(color = "white"), 
    plot.title = element_text(color = "white", hjust = 0.5, face = "bold"),  
    legend.background = element_rect(fill = "gray20", color = "black"), 
    legend.text = element_text(color = "white"), 
    legend.title = element_text(color = "white"))
```

Great, we can see that the number of sales per channel is fairly balanced, with a difference of only 8 sales, which is barely a 2% difference. Given the size of the dataset, this difference is not significant, so we will proceed with our analysis. From now on, we will focus solely on the Online channel, as running ads for the website will be easier for the marketing team, and it will also make the analysis more straightforward. Let's create a new dataset using the channel filter.

```{r}
# Filter only Online Channel orders
online_orders <- Data2 %>%
  filter(Purchase_Channel == "Online")
```

Now let's see which category brings more income focusing in the online channel

```{r}

# Plot 1: Total Purchase Amount per Category
plot_revenue <- ggplot(online_orders, aes(x = reorder(Purchase_Category, Purchase_Amount, sum), y = Purchase_Amount, fill = Purchase_Category)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Total Purchase Amount by Category (Online)",
       x = "Purchase Category",
       y = "Total Purchase Amount") +
  theme_minimal()

# Plot 2: Number of Purchases per Category
plot_popularity <- ggplot(online_orders, aes(x = Purchase_Category, fill = Purchase_Category)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Number of Purchases by Category (Online)",
       x = "Purchase Category",
       y = "Number of Purchases") +
  theme_minimal()

plot_revenue

plot_popularity
```

Oh no! This looks pretty cluttered with so many categories, and we're not able to extract any useful insights from it. Let's narrow it down by filtering the top 5 categories, so we can gain better insights. We'll also plot them separately.

```{r}
# Get the top 5 categories by number of purchases
top5_popularity <- online_orders %>%
  count(Purchase_Category, name = "num_purchases") %>%
  arrange(desc(num_purchases)) %>%
  slice_head(n = 5)  # Select top 5

# Top 5 Categories by Number of Purchases
plot_Cat_popularity <- ggplot(top5_popularity, aes(x = reorder(Purchase_Category, num_purchases), y = num_purchases, fill = Purchase_Category)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Top 5 Categories by Popularity (Online)",
       x = "Purchase Category",
       y = "Number of Purchases") +
  theme(
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "gray20", color = "black"), 
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "gray20"), 
    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "white", linetype = "dashed"),  
    panel.grid.minor = element_line(color = "white", linetype = "dashed"),  
    axis.text = element_text(color = "white"),  
    axis.title = element_text(color = "white"), 
    plot.title = element_text(color = "white", hjust = 0.5, face = "bold"),  
    legend.background = element_rect(fill = "gray20", color = "black"), 
    legend.text = element_text(color = "white"), 
    legend.title = element_text(color = "white"))

plot_Cat_popularity
```

```{r}
# Get the top 5 categories by revenue of purchases
top5_revenue <- online_orders %>%
  group_by(Purchase_Category) %>%
  summarise(total_revenue = sum(Purchase_Amount)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_revenue)) %>%
  slice_head(n = 5)  # Select top 5

# Plot: Top 5 Categories by Revenue
plot_Cat_revenue <- ggplot(top5_revenue, aes(x = reorder(Purchase_Category, total_revenue), y = total_revenue, fill = Purchase_Category)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Top 5 Categories by Revenue (Online)",
       x = "Purchase Category",
       y = "Total Purchase Amount") +
  theme(
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "gray20", color = "black"), 
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "gray20"), 
    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "white", linetype = "dashed"),  
    panel.grid.minor = element_line(color = "white", linetype = "dashed"),  
    axis.text = element_text(color = "white"),  
    axis.title = element_text(color = "white"), 
    plot.title = element_text(color = "white", hjust = 0.5, face = "bold"),  
    legend.background = element_rect(fill = "gray20", color = "black"), 
    legend.text = element_text(color = "white"), 
    legend.title = element_text(color = "white"))

plot_Cat_revenue
```


Very interesting! It's clear that we have a clear winner: Sports & Outdoors. Also, considering that summer is just around the corner, running an ad campaign for this product would be a great proposal. Toys and Games come in second place in both graphs, which is also promising for sales, as kids love summer and will likely be getting new gear to play with their friends or at home.

Next, let's analyze which gender group is the most profitable for our online channel.

```{r}
plot_genderdis_sp <- ggplot(online_orders %>% filter(Purchase_Category == "Sports & Outdoors"), aes(x = Gender, fill = Gender)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Gender Distribution of Sports & Outdoors Purchases",
       x = "Gender",
       y = "Number of Purchases") +
  theme(
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "gray20", color = "black"), 
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "gray20"), 
    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "white", linetype = "dashed"),  
    panel.grid.minor = element_line(color = "white", linetype = "dashed"),  
    axis.text = element_text(color = "white"),  
    axis.title = element_text(color = "white"), 
    plot.title = element_text(color = "white", hjust = 0.5, face = "bold"),  
    legend.background = element_rect(fill = "gray20", color = "black"), 
    legend.text = element_text(color = "white"), 
    legend.title = element_text(color = "white"))

plot_genderamnt_sp <- ggplot(online_orders %>% filter(Purchase_Category == "Sports & Outdoors"), aes(x = Gender, y = Purchase_Amount, fill = Gender)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(title = "Gender Distribution of Sales in Sports & Outdoors Purchases by Volume",
       x = "Gender",
       y = "Volume of Purchases") +
  theme(
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "gray20", color = "black"), 
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "gray20"), 
    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "white", linetype = "dashed"),  
    panel.grid.minor = element_line(color = "white", linetype = "dashed"),  
    axis.text = element_text(color = "white"),  
    axis.title = element_text(color = "white"), 
    plot.title = element_text(color = "white", hjust = 0.5, face = "bold"),  
    legend.background = element_rect(fill = "gray20", color = "black"), 
    legend.text = element_text(color = "white"), 
    legend.title = element_text(color = "white"))

plot_genderdis_sp
plot_genderamnt_sp
```

We can clearly see that women make a large number of purchases and have the highest purchase volume. However, men make fewer purchases, but it seems their average purchase amounts are higher. We will balance the dataset by taking an equal number of men and women to evaluate if the purchase volume is still higher among women.

```{r}
online_orders_filtered <- online_orders %>%
  filter(Gender == c("Male","Female"))

# Resumir los montos de compra por género
gender_summary <- online_orders_filtered %>%
  group_by(Gender) %>%
  summarise(Average_Purchase_Amount = mean(Purchase_Amount, na.rm = TRUE),
            Total_Purchase_Amount = sum(Purchase_Amount, na.rm = TRUE),
            Purchase_Count = n())

# Mostrar resumen
print(gender_summary)
```


```{r}
# Realizar una prueba t para comparar los montos promedio de compra entre hombres y mujeres
t_test_result <- t.test(Purchase_Amount ~ Gender, data = online_orders_filtered)

# Ver los resultados de la prueba t
print(t_test_result)
```


```{r}
# Visualizar la distribución de los montos de compra para hombres y mujeres
ggplot(online_orders_filtered, aes(x = Gender, y = Purchase_Amount, color = Gender)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Distribución de los Montos de Compra por Género",
       x = "Género",
       y = "Monto de Compra")  +
  theme(
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "gray20", color = "black"), 
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "gray20"), 
    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "white", linetype = "dashed"),  
    panel.grid.minor = element_line(color = "white", linetype = "dashed"),  
    axis.text = element_text(color = "white"),  
    axis.title = element_text(color = "white"), 
    plot.title = element_text(color = "white", hjust = 0.5, face = "bold"),  
    legend.background = element_rect(fill = "gray20", color = "black"), 
    legend.text = element_text(color = "white"), 
    legend.title = element_text(color = "white"))
```

With the results from the t-test and the box plot, we can see that the difference between these two genders is not significant. Therefore, focusing the campaign exclusively on men or women would not lead to a significant difference compared to the other genders, which have a much lower purchase volume.

The t-test result shows a t-value of -0.65828 with a p-value of 0.5114, indicating that there is no statistically significant difference between the mean purchase amounts for women (261.63) and men (275.50). The 95% confidence interval for the difference in means ranges from -55.51 to 27.77, which includes 0, further confirming that the difference is not statistically significant.

Now let's figure out if there's an impact for the purchase amount if we consider the age. 

```{r}
plot_agedis_sp <- ggplot(online_orders %>% filter(Purchase_Category == "Sports & Outdoors"), aes(x = Age)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = "Light Green", color = "Black") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, max(online_orders$Age), by = 5), 
                     labels = seq(0, max(online_orders$Age), by = 5)) +
  labs(title = "Age Distribution of Sports & Outdoors Customers",
       x = "Age",
       y = "Number of Purchases") +
  theme(
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "gray20", color = "black"), 
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "gray20"), 
    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "white", linetype = "dashed"),  
    panel.grid.minor = element_line(color = "white", linetype = "dashed"),  
    axis.text = element_text(color = "white"),  
    axis.title = element_text(color = "white"), 
    plot.title = element_text(color = "white", hjust = 0.5, face = "bold"),  
    legend.background = element_rect(fill = "gray20", color = "black"), 
    legend.text = element_text(color = "white"), 
    legend.title = element_text(color = "white"))

plot_agedis_sp
```

As we can see, most of the sales are focused on the age range of 20 to 30 years, so we can target the ads to this audience, expecting the campaign to have a higher conversion rate and the profits from it to be greater. Now lets check if the income level has any influence on the purchases.

```{r}
plot_income_sp <- ggplot(online_orders %>% filter(Purchase_Category == "Sports & Outdoors"), aes(x = Income_Level, y = Purchase_Amount, fill = Income_Level)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Income Level vs Purchase Amount for Sports & Outdoors",
       x = "Income Level",
       y = "Total Purchase Amount") +
  theme(
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "gray20", color = "black"), 
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "gray20"), 
    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "white", linetype = "dashed"),  
    panel.grid.minor = element_line(color = "white", linetype = "dashed"),  
    axis.text = element_text(color = "white"),  
    axis.title = element_text(color = "white"), 
    plot.title = element_text(color = "white", hjust = 0.5, face = "bold"),  
    legend.background = element_rect(fill = "gray20", color = "black"), 
    legend.text = element_text(color = "white"), 
    legend.title = element_text(color = "white")  
  )

plot_income_sp
```

As expected, the group with higher income has had a higher purchase level compared to the middle-income group. Therefore, we can focus a campaign on relatively high-priced products and test whether we can sell products that lead to a higher purchase ticket.

Now lets check, do customer are influenced by discounts, let's see if this happens evaluating the Discount sensitivity variable:

```{r}
plot_income_sp <- ggplot(online_orders %>% filter(Purchase_Category == "Sports & Outdoors"), aes(x = Discount_Sensitivity, y = Purchase_Amount, fill = Discount_Sensitivity)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Discount Sensitivity vs Purchase Amount for Sports & Outdoors",
       x = "Discount Sensitivity",
       y = "Total Purchase Amount") +
  theme(
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "gray20", color = "black"), 
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "gray20"), 
    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "white", linetype = "dashed"),  
    panel.grid.minor = element_line(color = "white", linetype = "dashed"),  
    axis.text = element_text(color = "white"),  
    axis.title = element_text(color = "white"), 
    plot.title = element_text(color = "white", hjust = 0.5, face = "bold"),  
    legend.background = element_rect(fill = "gray20", color = "black"), 
    legend.text = element_text(color = "white"), 
    legend.title = element_text(color = "white")  
  )

plot_income_sp
```

As can be seen in the graph, most customers are sensitive to discounts. However, we cannot confirm that they actually use them. Let's check if that's the case.

```{r}
ggplot(online_orders, aes(x = Discount_Sensitivity, fill = Discount_Used)) +
  geom_bar(position = "stack") +  # Apilar las barras
  labs(title = "Distribución del Uso del Descuento por Sensibilidad al Descuento",
       x = "Sensibilidad al Descuento",
       y = "Número de Compras") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("gray", "darkgreen")) +  # Opcional: personalizar los colores
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "gray20", color = "black"), 
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "gray20"), 
    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "white", linetype = "dashed"),  
    panel.grid.minor = element_line(color = "white", linetype = "dashed"),  
    axis.text = element_text(color = "white"),  
    axis.title = element_text(color = "white"), 
    plot.title = element_text(color = "white", hjust = 0.5, face = "bold"),  
    legend.background = element_rect(fill = "gray20", color = "black"), 
    legend.text = element_text(color = "white"), 
    legend.title = element_text(color = "white")  
  )

It seems that only customers with a high sensitivity to discounts make considerable use of them. This could mean that the store’s discounts are attractive, but they are not used as much as expected by customers.

To conclude, it would be very useful to evaluate if there is any seasonal trend or peak in sales. This way, we can define two key aspects: 

  1. If we can take advantage of a normal sales increase by further boosting it with ads targeted at a profitable audience.
  2. To ensure that if there is an increase in sales when the campaign is launched, it is due to the campaign itself and not just the normal seasonal increase in sales.

```{r}
online_orders <- online_orders %>%
  mutate(Month = floor_date(Time_of_Purchase, "month"))

monthly_sales <- online_orders %>%
  group_by(Month) %>%
  summarise(Total_Purchase_Amount = sum(Purchase_Amount, na.rm = TRUE))

ggplot(monthly_sales, aes(x = Month, y = Total_Purchase_Amount)) +
  geom_line(color = "white", linewidth = 1) + 
  geom_point(color = "red", size = 4) +
  labs(title = "Tendencia de Compras a lo Largo del Tiempo",
       x = "Fecha (Mes)",
       y = "Monto Total de Compras") +
  theme(
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "gray20", color = "black"), 
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "gray20"), 
    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "white", linetype = "dashed"),  
    panel.grid.minor = element_line(color = "white", linetype = "dashed"),  
    axis.text = element_text(color = "white"),  
    axis.title = element_text(color = "white"), 
    plot.title = element_text(color = "white", hjust = 0.5, face = "bold"),  
    legend.background = element_rect(fill = "gray20", color = "black"), 
    legend.text = element_text(color = "white"), 
    legend.title = element_text(color = "white")  
  )
```

As we can see in the time graph, starting from March and April, there is a natural increase in sales in the online store. This could be due to the season, and it will be a key point in the analysis when comparing the benefits generated by the campaign, since sales will increase regardless.

## Conclusions

Based on all the information gathered, we can see that a season with a high sales volume is approaching. For this reason, we must design a campaign that allows us to take advantage of this increase in sales. According to our exploratory analysis, we can consider that targeting men and women between the ages of 20 and 30, with an interest in the Sports & Outdoors category, could be the best strategy.

Additionally, this campaign should include a set of specific discounts. Given the income level of the customers, we can expect them to purchase high-value products. Since most of them are receptive to discounts but not all actively use them, we can take advantage of this by offering promotions on products that result in a high average ticket while ensuring that the discounts still maintain a strong profit margin.

## Next Steps

Although our analysis ends here, we can also consider a possible follow-up. By applying cluster analysis, we could use Machine Learning and more advanced statistical techniques to identify statistically significant groups that may generate higher revenue for the company.

Additionally, a dashboard could be designed in Power BI or Tableau to enable teams responsible for promotions, customer behavior analysis, and offer generation to monitor data in real-time. This could be achieved through automated pipelines, ensuring constant data updates and allowing for quick decision-making and strategy adjustments based on the latest insights.
